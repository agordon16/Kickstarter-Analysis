# Kickstarter-Analysis
Analyze Kickstarter Data to determine trends
## Overview
Louise launched a fundraising campaign for her play Fever and came very close to meeting her goal. Analyzing the Kickstarter data set to compare other fundraising campaigns based on launch dates and funding goals can assist to see how other campaign outcomes were affected in relation to these two points. This analysis can provide Louise with information that will guide her, hopefully, to a better outcome in her next fundraising effort.
### Analysis
  Based on data about Louise's play (goal, outcome, country, launch date, and category) the dataset was filtered out by country, launch date, and outcome to provide insight as to   when the best time to launch a campaign might be as well as trends on the best potentially attainable goal figures.
